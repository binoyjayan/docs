VPN Configuration
=================

DNS servers changes
--------------------
Turn on promiscuous mode in the virtual box network settings for the guest.

Now inside the guest, check the DNS settings in /etc/resolv.conf
These DNS servers may be blocking or doing traffic filteration.
Do not edit this file directly.

Instead edit this:
vim /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

Uncomment 'prepend domain-name-servers' line.
Change the name server from 127.0.0.1 to something not in your own country.
Search for 'OpenDNS IP Addresses'
Paste bothe the IP Addresses in the line above seperated by comma
and terminated by semicolon.

Ex:
prepend domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222,208.67.220.220;
service network-manager restart

Now check the file '/etc/resolv.conf' again
You may find this:
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
nameserver 192.168.1.1  [ or nameserver 10.0.2.3]

To remove the third one which is the gateway in the LAN and which would eventually
connect to the ISPs DNS server, find one more open DNS server from internet
Or mention a fake one and add it to the 'domain-name-servers' list.
Or you can add google's DNS '8.8.8.8'.
Only three DNS servers are used at a time.

NB: Please read the reputation about the DNS servers in terms of anonymity.

If you use a proxy and DNS servers from different countries, it gives more anonymity.

Disable Webrtc
---------------
Disable webrtc to avoid firefox leaking your information.
Firefox -> Type "about:config"
The message 'This might void your warranty' is shown.
Click on 'I'll be careful. I promise'

Search 'media.peerconnection.enabled'
Double click it to change it to false if true.
Restart the browser.

VPN Configuration
------------------

Use NAT instead of Bridge networking in host if neccessary.

Goto www.openvpn.com/freevpn or search for 'Free openvpn'.
Choose vpn from a country - Canada/German/French.

Download the package. Note the username and password.
Close the browser before starting VPN.

Unzip the zip file.

Run the command [vpnbook-de233-tcp443.ovpn is a file in the archive]:

openvpn vpnbook-de233-tcp443.ovpn

Type username,password

Look for the message 'Initialization sequence completed'

Now check your ip in browser and do dns leak test.
It should show dns settings in the one you picked.
