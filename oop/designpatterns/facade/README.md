### Facade design pattern

Provides a simple, easy to understand user interface
over a large and sophisticated body of code. Optionally, the
designers of this pattern could also expose internals of the
APIs to allow power users to use more complex APIs if they need to.

##### Usage examples
 
The Facade pattern is commonly used in apps written in C++. 
It is especially handy when working with complex libraries and APIs.

##### Identification

Facade can be recognized in a class that has a simple interface,
but delegates most of the work to other classes. Usually, facades manage the
full life cycle of objects they use.
