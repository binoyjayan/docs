### Composite design pattern

- A mechanism of treating individual (scalar)
objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner

- Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition
- Composition lets us make compound objects
  - i.e., Foo and Collection\<Foo\> may have common APIs
