### State design pattern

A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state.
An object transitions from one state to another (the is usually a trigger
for this transition).

A formalized construct that manages state and transitions is called
a state machine.

Changes in the state can be explicit on in response
to an event (Observer).
