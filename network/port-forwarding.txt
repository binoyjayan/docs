Local Port forwarding
----------------------------------------

Assume there is a server (S1) that has port 22 open and can be accessed
via ssh from a local machine (L1). S1 also has access to a remote server R1
on port 'nnnn'. However L1 does not have direct access to it.
In this case L1 can tunnel its data destined for R1 via L1 using the
following command and by opening a local port 'mmmm'.

ssh -L mmmm:R1:nnnn  user@S1

Note that L1 has ssh access to S1 on port 22.

Sometimes, if S1 and R1 are the same, the command simplifies to:

ssh -L mmmm:localhost:nnnn  user@S1

Example:
ssh -L 9999:127.0.0.1:8888  ubuntu@20.236.21.105
